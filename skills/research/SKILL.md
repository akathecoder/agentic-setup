# Research

Investigate a question against **primary sources** and capture the findings as a
project artifact. Dispatch the investigation to a background agent when the harness
can; otherwise research in this session.

Resolve every `.agents/projects/` path from the repository root; never read or write
project artifacts in a global agent-installation directory.

## Process

1. Identify the active project and the question. Read its `CONTEXT.md` and `LINKS.md`
   when they exist so the investigation uses confirmed project language.

   Done when the question and the project slug are known.

2. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it: official docs, specs, source
   code, first-party APIs. Prefer those over a secondary write-up.

   Done when every retained finding traces to a primary source.

3. Write `.agents/projects/<project>/research-<slug>.md` using the structure below.
   Cite each claim. Record the path in `LINKS.md`.

   Done when a later session can use the file without this conversation, and the user
   has the path.

## Document

```md
# Research: <question>

## Findings

<Each claim, with the source that owns it.>

## Sources

<Primary sources consulted.>

## Open

<What the sources did not settle.>
```

## Done when

- Every finding cites a primary source.
- `.agents/projects/<project>/research-<slug>.md` holds the investigation.
- Project links point at the file.
